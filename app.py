st.write('''In this project, a natural language processing (NLP) model is developed to predict person's personality type using Myers Briggs Personality test (MBTI). The input to the model is people's sample text and the model makes predictions about their MBTI's personality type.

The Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is an introspective self-report questionnaire indicating differing psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. The test attempts to assign four categories: introversion or extroversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling, judging or perceiving. One letter from each category is taken to produce a four-letter test result, like "INFJ" or "ENFP". (Source: Wikipedia)

This project has wide range of business applications. If we know how certain people interact with their environment we can make proper recommendations to them. The recommendations can range from book, or movie recommendations to the next travel destination. For example, introverted people may want to be engaged in more relaxed activities in comparison to extroverts who like large parties and adventures.''')

st.title('Getting a data:')

st.write('''This project has four parts which look at different aspects of a person's personality. This notebook is looking at predicting four different aspects of personality in people by analyzing their social media posts. Dataset for this project is mainly from Kaggle website complemented by tweets consisting of personality tags. Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/mbti-type. The accuracy of the model is 80% on a Test set.''')

         aspects of the personality. Second approach is selected to avoid the possible issues with the class imbalance and also the better accuracy. Four different labels are between 'I' or 'E', 'N' or 'S',\
             'F' or 'T', 'J' or 'P' in which 'I' stands for introvert, 'E' stands for extrovert, 'N' is intuitive, 'S' is sensing, 'F' is feeling, 'T' is thinking, 'P' is perceiving, and 'J' is judging.

st.write('''The first step is to categorize the training and test sets. Categorization is to split data based on following labels: 'I' or 'E', 'N' or 'S',\
