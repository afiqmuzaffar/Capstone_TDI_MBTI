# Predicting MBTI personality score of a person base on their social media post.

The Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is an introspective self-report questionnaire indicating differing psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. The test attempts to assign four categories: introversion or extroversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling, judging or perceiving. One letter from each category is taken to produce a four-letter test result, like "INFJ" or "ENFP". (Source: Wikipedia)

This project has wide range of business applications. If we know how certain people interact with their environment we can make proper recommendations to them. The recommendations can range from book, or movie recommendations to the next travel destination. For example, introverted people may want to be engaged in more relaxed activities in comparison to extroverts who like large parties and adventures.
