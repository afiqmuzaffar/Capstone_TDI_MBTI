    "# Introduction:\n",
    "The Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is an introspective self-report questionnaire indicating differing psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. The test attempts to assign four categories: introversion or extraversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling, judging or perceiving. One letter from each category is taken to produce a four-letter test result, like \"INFJ\" or \"ENFP\". (Source: Wikipedia)"

    "# Preprocessing:\n",
    "The first part of the project is data exploration and labeling. Data exploration will give an intuition about how to go about the Machine learning algorithm. We are using supervised learning in which the data has been already labeled, however, we need to determine which posts are related to introverts.This can be done by looking at \"I\" in \"INFP\" and classify those labels as an introvert person. Example below demonstrates how the data generally looks like:\n",
